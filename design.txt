Okay, we have to do this because otherwise we go crazy.

Trade'Raid? 
Inn management? 
Deck builder?

I guess all three. 

Okay: You have been given a charter to manage the local area. 

What does that mean?

That means threats come in, and you respond appropriately.

What's in, what's a threat, what is a response and what makes one appropriate?

In: A graph over some geography. Really, start with random map generation and go from there.

Threat: Monsters start walking the world. The can pass through, or settle down. Same with tribes. (LOTS to that. Start simple.)

Response: Send an adventurer? A party? Sure, I guess.

Appropriate:
  Under-reaction leads to failures - disharmony, loss of lives, etc.


Okay, so the simplest graph:

Locations linked by distance, sure 

We can draw that, even. Woo. It's hideous, but we made it.

Do we want to stay pure functional, given the lack of multithreading? Or go branch by branch?

Branch by branch, you anchole. Don't fall down tha twell again.

Okay, grid time.

For now, each grid square can be:
  Mountain
  Forest
  Desert
  Town
  Hills
  Field
  Ocean
  Lake
